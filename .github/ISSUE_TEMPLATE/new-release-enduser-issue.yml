      ## Notes
      1. We are not adding detailed updates for the Block settings - Typography, Color, Layout, Dimension and Border and for the More Options setting in the block toolbar. Pls mention the settings included for the block and link to the detailed settings pages instead.
      2. Some of the PRs have great videos that can be added to the article
